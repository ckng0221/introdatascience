#### What is BMI?

**Body Mass Index (BMI)** is essentially a value obtained from the weight and height of a person. <br><br>


#### Calculating the BMI
BMI can be computed by dividing the person's weight (kg) by their squared height (m) as follows:

> BMI = kg/m^2

where *kg* represents the person's weight and *m^2* the person's squared height. <br><br>
